## Important Note

- This repository includes an `ExportedFile.episerverdata` file in the root folder, which contains all initial content for Optimizely SaaS CMS. You can import this file into your Optimizely instance to get started with pre-configured content.
- This template focuses on core functionality that is common to all projects, such as fetching content from Optimizely Graph, preview functionality, routing, Visual Builder and cache revalidation. The design is intentionally simple and serves as an example — each project will have its own design requirements.

## Importing Content to Optimizely

1. Log in to your Optimizely SaaS CMS instance
2. **Important**: Make sure to add "Polish" language in your CMS settings before importing content to ensure successful import
3. Go to Admin > Tools > Import Data
4. Upload the `ExportedFile.episerverdata` file from the root of this project
5. Follow the import wizard to complete the process

## Environment Variables

- `OPTIMIZELY_API_URL`: The base URL for the Optimizely Graph (typically "https://cg.optimizely.com/content/v2")
- `OPTIMIZELY_SINGLE_KEY`: Your Optimizely Content Graph API key
- `OPTIMIZELY_PREVIEW_SECRET`: Generated base64 string based on your AppKey and AppSecret credentials. For more details I recommend you to take a look at Kunal's article: https://kunalshetye.com/posts/optimizely-graph-using-appkey-appsecret/
- `OPTIMIZELY_REVALIDATE_SECRET`: A secret key used for revalidating cached content
- `OPTIMIZELY_START_PAGE_URL`: Defines the full route URL of the Start Page in Optimizely CMS. When using hierarchical routing, Optimizely does not assign the root path `/` to the Start Page by default. Instead, the Start Page must have an explicit URL like "/start-page". This impacts the overall routing logic and cache revalidation mechanisms. Therefore, this variable must be set manually to indicate the correct URL of the Start Page.
- `OPTIMIZELY_START_PAGE_KEY`: The content key of the Start Page to fetch on the site homepage. This makes homepage selection deterministic when multiple Start Page entries exist.
- `NEXT_PUBLIC_CMS_URL`: The URL of your SaaS CMS instance

## Future Enhancements

This template is actively maintained and will be updated to support new features and improvements in Optimizely SaaS CMS as they become available. Stay tuned for future enhancements!
